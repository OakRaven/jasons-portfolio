      To whom it may concern,
    </p>
    <p>
      I am writing in hopes of obtaining a part-time job in which incorporates artistic, organizational, social, and leadership skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am very dedicated to all of my work, and I focus on both quality and quantity, to achieve a superbly-done outcome to all of my assigned tasks. I work well with others and am always willing to work with, and get to know, new people. I am open to new ideas and am always willing to try new things while taking in suggestions from groups. I am able to visualize a completed project / task and apply my artistic and organizational skills to obtain the desired outcome. The position I am applying for would use attributes that I had been able to obtain throughout the course of my life, such as; working in groups, listening to everyoneâ€™s opinion, organizing events and / or projects, applying artistic abilities to achieve a well-done result, and helping the entirety of the group(s) that I work with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for considering me for the position, I will follow up with an email.
    </p>
    <p>
      Respectfully yours,
    </p>
    <p>
